## FAQ

**Q: How do I adjust the score limits?**  
A: You can adjust the score to win by setting the `PONG_SCORE_TO_WIN` variable in the `Pong` script. You can set this value to a maximum of 255. You can also update the score in the `Pong.cs` script by changing the variable initilzation as well.

**Q: Can I add additional levels?**  
A: Yes, you can add other mini game levels. You can create another subclass of the `MiniGameLevel` and update/add all the necessary functions for your neew game. Then, you then can create a new subclass of `ScoreManager` to handle the scoring system for your new mini game.

**Q: Can I update the speed of the paddles?**
A: Yes, you can update the speed of the paddles by going into the `Paddle.cs` script and changing the `speed` variable to whatever you would like. By default, it is set to 10.

**Q: Can I update the base and maximum speed of the ball?**
A: Yes, you can update the maximum speed of the ball by clicking on the `Ball` sprite in the Unity editor. There is a variable attached to the sprite called `Speed` which is the base speed. It is set to 5 by default. To update the max speed of the ball, you can update the other variable in the editor called `BALL_MAX_SPEED` to whatever you like. It is set to 15 by default.

**Q: Can I update the sprites**
A: Yes, you can update the sprites in the mini game. To do so, you can click on the element you want to update in the hierarchy, and drag and drop your new sprite into the `Sprite` tab in the `Sprite Renderer`.

**Q: How do I set up Mobile?**
A: The Pong game automatically detects if it is running on an Android or iOS device, and will enable the buttons for you. There is no setup or extra work required of you to do so.
