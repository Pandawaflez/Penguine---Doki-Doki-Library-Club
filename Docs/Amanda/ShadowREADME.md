## FAQ

**Q: How do I adjust the affection points?**  
A: You can adjust the affection points to your heart's desire by editing the `ProcessChoice` method in the `ShadowNormalState` script. You can set the dialogue.affectionManager.ChangeShadowAffectionPOints(value) to any value you would like based on the given dialogue response. 

**Q: Can I add additional dialogue?**  
A: Yes, you can additional dialogue, including an extra dialogue box if wanted. You can also create another dialogue response option within your playerResponses list. For instance, if you wanted three dialogue response options you would seperate each with a comma, as shown `new string[] {"I'm here to talk to you, you seem pretty cool.", "I was just curious how they allowed you in here.", "Hey here is the third dialogue response"},` and assign the new button as ResponseButton 3 in your inspector window of the DialogueController Game Object. 

**Q: Can I customize the affection point display?**
A: Yes, you can modify the affection point display by changing it to a meter, different text color, whichever you prefer. By default, affection points are set to 0 then dynamically updated through the affectionManager observer. 

**Q: What is BC Mode?**
A: BC mode was implemented for players who struggle in the dating scene. Affection points can never go below 0, and the player will always win in BC mode. 

**Q: Can I update the sprites?**
A: Yes, you can update the sprites to your own character. To do so, you can click on the element you want to update in the hierarchy, and drag and drop your new sprite into the `Sprite` tab in the `Sprite Renderer`.
