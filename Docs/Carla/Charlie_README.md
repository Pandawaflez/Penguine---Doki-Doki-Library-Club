## FAQ

**Q: How do I change the dialouges and/or responses?**  
A: You can adjust dialogues by changing the dialogue strings in the `CharlieDialogue` class in the `Dialogue.cs` file. You can change the dialogues to whatever you would like, as well as the response options. To change the order of conversation, you will have to edit the `toNextDialogue()` function in the `Charlie.cs` script. Each switch case is the dialogue that Charlie is on, and the `p_dialogueNum` indicates which response was just hit. You can change the `p_dialogueNum` to whatever new dialogue you want to go to.

**Q: Can I add additional dialogues?**  
A: Yes, you can add other mini game levels. Just like the instructions above, you can add additional dialogue strings in `Dialogue.cs`. You will then have to add the corresponding switch statements in `toNextDialogue()` in the `Charlie.cs` script, following the same logic. You will also have to update `v_displayDialogue()` in the in the `CharlieDialogue` class in the `Dialogue.cs` file. Simply add an additional case and call `displayRealDialogue()` with the new strings you wrote.

**Q: How do I change the affection points?**
A: You can edit the progression of Charlie's affection points in the `toNextDialogue()` function in the `Charlie.cs` script. Any call to `updateAffection()` can be passed a different integer that updates his affection.

**Q: What does BC Mode do**
A: BC Mode makes it so Charlie's affection points are easier for the player to gain. His affection points will never go down to a negative responses, and any positive responses increases his affection by twice the normal amount.

**Q: Can I update the sprite?**
A: Yes, you can update the sprite. To do so, you can click on the Charlie in the hierarchy, and drag and drop your new sprite into the `Sprite` tab in the `Sprite Renderer`.

**Q: Can I change the dialogue and response button displays?**
A: Yes, you can change the appearance of the dialogue and responses. To do so, click the elemtn you want to update in the hierarchy, and change the settings as desired in the Inspection window. Note that relative sizes are locked in order to ensure the dialogues and buttons display correctly depending on window size changes, so you can only edit actual panel sizes en masse through the `Scale` variable in `DialoguePanel`.
